# dream-vacation

## This is a website that Daren Schaad and I made while attending class at Epicodus, January 2016.

### During class we learned out to use Bootstrap. Our asignment was to make a site about our "dream-vacation site" while 
### using elements and classes in Bootstrap, such as columns, resizing things on the screen and adding images.
